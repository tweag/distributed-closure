-- $static-dicts
--
-- A 'Dict' reifies a constraint in the form of a first class value. The 'Dict'
-- type is not serializable: how do you serialize the constraint that values of
-- this type carry? Whereas, for any constraint @c@, a value of type @'Closure'
-- ('Dict' c)@ /can/ be serialized and sent over the wire, just like any
-- 'Closure'. A /static dictionary/ for some constraint @c@ is a value of type
-- @'Closure' ('Dict' c)@.

-- | It's often useful to create a static dictionary on-the-fly given any
-- constraint. Morally, all type class constraints have associated static
-- dictionaries, since these are either global values or simple combinations
-- thereof. But GHC doesn't yet know how to invent a static dictionary on-demand
-- yet given any type class constraint, so we'll have to do it manually for the
-- time being. By defining instances of this type class manually, or via
-- 'Control.Distributed.Closure.TH.withStatic' if it becomes too tedious.
